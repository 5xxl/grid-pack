# Getting Started

## Installation
Choose an installation method:

### Roblox Studio
Get the [latest release from the Github](https://github.com/Frexsim/grid-pack/releases/latest). Then right click on ReplicatedStorage and choose `Insert from File...` and choose the downloaded .rbxm file. If you've done everything correctly you should now have a Packages folder with GridPack inside!

## Pre-release Statement
GridPack is in a pre-release state and is not yet quite ready for production! But once GridPack hits v1.0.0 it means no more alpha state! If you find any bugs, please report them in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Frexsim/grid-pack/issues) in the repository. There may also be missing features at the moment, so please write a suggestion (which can also be done in the Issues tab) or add the feature yourself and submit a pull request!
